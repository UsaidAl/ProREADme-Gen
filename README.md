# ProREADme-Generator

## Description

This is my README.md generator. This week 9 challenge utilises Node.js and the inquirer package to gather project details from the user, including the project title, description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, test instructions, a chosen license, GitHub username and an email address. The tool then generates a formatted README.md document incorporating these inputs.

## Installation

In the terminal, you have to first type the command 'npm i'. This command installs all the necessary packages, including the 'inquirer' package for user input. Once the installation is complete, you can initiate the README generator by entering 'node index.js' in the terminal. This command will run the code.

## Screenshots

#### Run 'node index.js' within the terminal to start the application.
